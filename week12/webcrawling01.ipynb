      "Título: Chocolate-Glazed Hazelnut Mousse Cake\n",
      "Descripción: This wonderfully rich, silky dessert is an ideal choice when you're entertaining a group of friends. Featuring a hazelnut shortbread crust that provides a crisp based for the moist, airy mousse, it is simple to prepare, can be made ahead of time, and does not require any last-minute fussing. Nutella -- beloved by Europeans (and by more Americans than admit to it) -- acts as a stealth ingredient that both echoes and enhances the marriage of the crust and the mousse. So whether you find yourself with or without a Valentine this year, it will be love at first bite. -- Lawrence Karol\n",
      "Ingredientes:\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons hazelnuts, toasted and skins rubbed off\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- ½ cup all-purpose flour\n",
      "- ¼ cup unsalted butter, softened\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder\n",
      "- ⅛ teaspoon salt\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon unflavored gelatin\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons cold water\n",
      "- ½ cup chocolate hazelnut spread such as Nutella\n",
      "- ½ cup mascarpone\n",
      "- 1 ½ cups chilled heavy cream\n",
      "- 2 tablespoons unsweetened Dutch-process cocoa powder\n",
      "- 3 tablespoons sugar\n",
      "- 5 tablespoons heavy cream\n",
      "- 3 ½ ounces fine-quality bittersweet chocolate (not unsweetened), chopped\n",
      "Instrucciones:\n",
      "- For shortbread base: Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Invert bottom of springform pan (to make it easier to slide shortbread base off bottom), then lock on side of pan and line bottom with a round of parchment paper.\n",
      "- Pulse hazelnuts with sugar in a food processor until nuts are finely chopped. Add flour, butter, cocoa, and salt and pulse just until a dough forms.\n",
      "- Press dough evenly onto bottom of springform pan with your fingers. Prick all over with a fork, then bake until just dry to the touch, about 18 to 20 minutes. Transfer base in pan to a rack to cool completely, about 30 minutes. Remove side of pan and carefully slide out parchment from under shortbread, then reattach side of pan around shortbread base.\n",
      "- Make mousse while shortbread cools: Sprinkle gelatin over water in a 1- to 1 1/2-quart heavy saucepan and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Heat gelatin mixture over low heat, stirring, just until gelatin is melted, about 2 minutes. Whisk in chocolate hazelnut spread until combined and remove from heat.\n",
      "- Whisk together mascarpone and chocolate hazelnut mixture in a large bowl. Beat together cream, cocoa powder, and sugar in another large bowl with an electric mixer at low speed until just combined, then increase speed to high and beat until cream just holds soft peaks. Whisk one third of whipped cream into mascarpone mixture to lighten, then fold in remaining whipped cream until well combined. Spoon filling onto shortbread base in pan, gently smoothing top, then chill, covered, at least 3 hours.\n",
      "- Make ganache and glaze cake: Bring cream to a simmer in a small heavy saucepan and remove from heat. Add chocolate and let stand 1 minute, then gently whisk until completely melted and smooth. Transfer ganache to a small bowl and cool, stirring occasionally, until slightly thickened but still pourable, about 20 minutes.\n",
      "- Run a warm thin knife around inside of springform pan, then remove side. Slide cake off bottom of pan and transfer to a serving plate. Pour ganache onto top of cake and spread, allowing excess ganache to drip down sides.\n",

      "Título: Grilled Spaghetti\n",
      "Descripción: Grilled spaghetti is cooked directly in a very simple sauce, so that all the extra flavor from toasting dry pasta on a grill stays in the sauce. This is delicious on its own as a side dish, or as a base for other grilled things like eggplant or chicken.\n",
      "Ingredientes:\n",
      "- 8 ounces thick dry spaghetti\n",

      "- 1/4 cup finely grated Parmigiano Reggiano or to taste\n",
      "- 1 pinch red chili flakes (optional)\n",
      "Instrucciones:\n",
      "- Prepare an outdoor charcoal grill for medium-high heat.\n",
      "- Place dry spaghetti on the hot charcoal grill, and cook, tossing often with tongs until the pasta is toasted to a light brown, about 4 minutes. Remove and set aside.\n",
      "- Add olive oil to a pan, and set over medium heat. Add garlic and sauté until fragrant, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add tomato paste and sauté for about 1 minute; pour in broth.\n",
      "- Raise heat to medium-high and bring broth to a simmer. Add salt and grilled spaghetti, and use tongs to move spaghetti back and forth until it softens enough to be covered by the broth.\n",
      "- Cook, stirring, until spaghetti is as tender as you like; it will take a few minutes longer than package directions indicate. If pan gets too dry, add another splash of broth.\n",
      "- Reduce heat to low; stir in butter and basil. Turn off heat and stir in cheese. Serve immediately.\n",

      "- \"I used fresh peaches and left the skins on for simplicity. They were barely noticeable the first night, but when I ate the leftovers they were kind of chewy and annoying.\" – blessedmommy\n",
      "- \"To remove the skin from peaches try blanching them; 30-45 seconds in boiling hot water taken off the heat followed by 15 seconds in an ice bath (to keep the peach from continuing to cook).\" – Molly\n",
      "- \"If you don't have flavorful, in-season peaches then go with frozen peaches—they are better than tasteless, grainy, fresh ones.\" – ripple2\n",

      "Título: Chef John's Strawberry Semifreddo\n",
      "Descripción: My lighter, no-cook adaptation of semifreddo skips the traditional egg custard and cuts down on fat, sugar, and time. It just so happens to be lighter, with a cleaner, more distinct berry flavor and a texture that's less creamy than classic semifreddo, falling somewhere between strawberry ice cream and a strawberry ice pop.\n",
      "Ingredientes:\n",
      "- 1 pound fresh strawberries\n",
      "- ½ cup white sugar\n",
      "- ¾ cup full-fat Greek yogurt\n",

Fill ramekins 1/4 to 1/8 inch from the top with the strawberry mixture. Tap baking sheet against the counter to settle the tops. Cover ramekins in plastic wrap and freeze until mostly firm, about 1 1/2 hours.\n",

      "- Divide the cookie crumb mixture among the ramekins and smooth out with the back of a spoon. Cover again and freeze until completely frozen, about 2 hours.\n",

Add in confectioner’s sugar; beat until thoroughly combined. Add in lemon zest, vanilla, and salt and mix until combined. Add in remaining confectioner’s sugar, 1 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. Add in 1 tablespoon cold coconut milk and beat mixture on medium-high speed for an additional 2 to 3 minutes. If frosting is a bit too soft to spread onto the cake layers, place it into the fridge for about 10 minutes, or until it is easier to use.\n",
      "- To assemble the cake, place one cake layer onto a cake plate or serving platter. Spread a thin layer of cream cheese frosting over the top of the cake. Pipe a ring of frosting around the top edge of the cake. Place about 2 tablespoons of lemon curd in the center of the frosting ring, and smooth into an even layer. Stack another cake layer on top of the first, and repeat the process of frosting and filling. When the last cake layer is stacked on top, frost the top and sides of the cake with a thin layer of frosting. Use your hands to press the toasted coconut flakes onto the sides of the cake. If desired, drizzle or swirl the top of cake with some of the extra lemon curd. Place cake into the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes before serving.\n",

No one wanted to dry off, get dressed, and go home for lunch. Mayonnaise didn’t travel well and wasn’t safe under the summer sun. Peanut butter sandwiches were a solution, but also suffered under the heat.\n",

A bake-on mustard and butter coating adds extra flavor.\n",

Simply make or buy a round unsliced bread loaf, cut off the top, scoop out the insides, and fill. The completed round sandwich stores well in the fridge overnight. Slice it ahead and put it in zip-top bags. Or, keep it in the circular form and wrap the entire sandwich for slicing and serving poolside.\n",

      "- Craving that classic Chili's app from home? Now there's an easy way to enjoy the restaurant favorite from your very own kitchen. These copycat snacks deliver all your favorite meaty, cheesy, and tangy flavors in one crispy tortilla package.\n",
      "- “Addictive little appetizers that are so easy to make, you’ll never go back to Chili’s!” raved Allrecipes recipe developer Amanda Stanfield. “The avocado ranch dip is the cherry on top and really punches up the eating experience.”\n",
      "- Gather all ingredients.\n",
      "- Mash 1 avocado half with a fork until smooth and creamy in a small bowl. Save remaining avocado half for another use. Whisk in mayonnaise, buttermilk, and ranch seasoning until smooth. Cover and refrigerate avocado ranch dip until ready to use.\n",
      "- Stir together chicken, cheese, corn, black beans, spinach, red bell pepper, scallions, pickled jalapeno, taco seasoning, and salt until well combined in a medium bowl.\n",
      "- Place about 1/2 cup of filling in the center of a tortilla. Fold in two sides of the tortilla over the filling and roll up very tightly. Secure seam with a toothpick. Transfer eggroll to a large plate. Repeat process with remaining tortillas and chicken mixture.\n",
      "- Pour oil to a depth of 1/2-inch in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet over medium-high until a thermometer reads 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), about 8 minutes. Add 3 to 4 eggrolls into hot oil, seam side down, and cook, until golden brown and crispy all over, 3 to 4 minutes, flipping halfway through cooking.  Transfer to a paper towel lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining eggrolls.\n",
      "- Remove toothpicks and slice each eggroll at an angle. Serve with avocado ranch dip.\n",

      "Ingredientes:\n",
      "- 1 1/2 cups cold whole milk\n",
      "- 1 (5.1-ounce) package vanilla instant pudding and pie filling (such as Jell-O)\n",
      "- 1 teaspoon vanilla extract\n",
      "- 2 1/2 cups plus 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream, divided\n",
      "- 1/4 cup confectioners’ sugar\n",
      "- 1 (14-ounce) can sweetened condensed milk\n",
      "- 1 (8-ounce) container sour cream\n",
      "- 1/4 cup salted caramel sauce, plus more microwaved sauce for drizzling\n",
      "- 1 (1 lb 7,7 oz box) buttery crackers (such as Ritz®) (about 98 crackers)\n",
      "- 6 cups thinly sliced spotted bananas (about 3 1/2 pounds bananas)\n",
      "- flakey sea salt\n",
      "Instrucciones:\n",
      "- Meet the no-bake, make-ahead dessert we can't get enough of right now. It's perfect for any event, any time of year, but especially a summer barbecue—and it's easy to whip together. The best part? It's a fun twist on a classic that uses everyone's favorite salty, buttery snack cracker. Introducing our Salted Caramel Banana Ritz Icebox Cake.\n",
      "- Just take it from recipe creator Renu Dhar, who says, \"The flavor is so very banana pudding. The saltiness from the Ritz crackers and salted caramel help balance out all the sweetness. The combination of the pudding and the whipped cream makes it light and airy—like eating clouds. The sour cream adds a slight tang that makes everything come together.\" In fact, Dhar even adds, \"I like it better than my aunt’s banana pudding and my aunt makes it all the time! It’s so creamy and so yummy.\"\n",
      "- Recipe tester Liz Mervosh gives some helpful tips: \"The salt on top is a must, it perfectly complements the sweetness of the pudding mixture.\" She also suggests that letting it sit for 8 hours in the fridge is the \"sweet spot.\" More specifically, \"At 4 hours, the crackers were too hard for me....and at 24 hours, it tasted great, but the crackers were too soft for me.\"\n",
      "- The test kitchen also notes further options for customization. Sprinkle toasted coconuts or chopped nuts over the bananas for added interest. Or, substitute mangoes or peaches for the bananas for a different flavor profile altogether. You can also use frozen whipped topping (like Cool Whip) instead of homemade whipped cream. However you make it, this icebox cake made in your trusty 9x13 is sure to be a hit.\n",
      "- Gather all ingredients.\n",
      "- Whisk together milk and pudding and pie filling in a large bowl until mostly smooth. Let stand until very thick, about 5 minutes.\n",
      "- Meanwhile, beat vanilla and 2 1/2 cups of the heavy whipping cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until soft peaks form, about 2 minutes. Gradually add confectioners' sugar, and beat until stiff peaks form, 15 to 30 seconds.\n",
      "- Whisk sweetened condensed milk and sour cream into thickened pudding until smooth. Fold in whipped cream until smooth and light.\n",
      "- Microwave 1/4 cup salted caramel and remaining 2 tablespoons heavy whipping cream in a small microwave-safe bowl on high until loosened, about 10 seconds; whisk to combine.\n",
      "- Place 32 of the crackers in an even layer in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish, breaking up crackers as needed to fill space. Spread 3 cups of the pudding mixture in an even layer over crackers. Top pudding mixture with 2 cups of the sliced bananas. Drizzle evenly with about 2 tablespoons of the salted caramel mixture. Repeat layering process once more, ending with a layer of salted caramel. Evenly top with remaining 34 crackers, breaking them as needed to fit. Spread remaining 3 cups pudding mixture over crackers.\n",
      "- Store, covered, in the refrigerator for at least 8 hours or up to overnight. Before serving, top with remaining 2 cups sliced bananas.\n",
      "- Drizzle with salted caramel sauce and sprinkle flaky sea salt.\n",
      "- Cut into slices and serve drizzled with extra caramel sauce if desired.\n",
